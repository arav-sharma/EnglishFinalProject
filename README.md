As part of my final project for Honors English II, I transformed my research essay into a blog-style article using React.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The article explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in K-12 education and its impact on modern-day educators. It delves into current applications, potential benefits, and challenges of AI in classrooms. This project showcases my ability to create dynamic and engaging web content. You can read the article [here](https://ai-k12.vercel.app/).

_Framework (Front-End):_
- Next.js (React.js, TypeScript)
- TailwindCSS
